# Welcome to Bahamas Challenge!

To use this application you can run the bahamas-core and mock-external-service which will provide you a mocked code to run and test the application. **BUT** if you wanted to use hardcoded mock, just search for the **TODO** and you will be able to use the hardcoded version.

# Java Version

**Java 11**


# API Root Link

[Bahamas Core ](http://localhost:8080/)

[Mock External Service](http://localhost:8081/)


# Author Notes

- In the wiki about the challenge I read about use the Invoice Id in the request but [here](https://invoicexpress.com/api-v2/clients/get-4) I have read that is the Client Id that is expected, doesnt change anything then the variable name but I wanted to make you know why I used this name.

- I decided to use the externals API's because, to me, was the more unusual choice and maybe would be cool do it.
